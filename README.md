#Phishing-Analysis
Hello. Here is a small python project that analysis phishing links to train a model to predict future links. 
A Flask app accesses a local daabase of records, and exposes the data for consumption via a simple API. Jupyter 
notebooks and various python packages are used to create and train a model to predict if a link is malicious or 
not based on a set of predefined rules to clasify the risk of each link.
